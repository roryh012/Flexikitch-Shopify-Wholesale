They are easy to work with and I have a great relationship with Co-Founder Alex and the team” reflects Ross.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">Mr Ledingham had spent 20 years building hospitality venues in both London and the Middle East prior to relocating to Australia with wife Christine, however their incredible rate of growth and accompanying success since is even more striking, considering its backdrop: immediately post-pandemic.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">“We actually opened our first (venue) about six months after we came out of Lockdown” Christine continues.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">“We were in a market where nobody wanted to make any moves. There was so much uncertainty, but as a result, so many opportunities at that time. I think we were lucky to have pounced on the opportunity, having had such a clear direction of where we wanted to take the business”.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal;"><font size="6">“Our vision of where we want to take the business in this first five years has kind of felt like an endless episode of The Block”</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">Unsurprisingly, given the amount of work they have undertaken in the past two years, the Ledinghams’ ongoing cycle of venue building, construction, investor partnerships and (in two cases) selling – has brought its own series of challenges.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">“Trying to grow at the pace we have been while continuing to be profitable has been hugely challenging. Our vision for where we want to take the business in this first five years has in some ways felt like an endless episode of The Block” Christine laughs.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">“We turned into a big business very quickly”.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">Given their extraordinary output since 2021, a theoretical season of ‘The Block’ following the Ledinghams would certainly have been captivating television. However, unlike many of that show’s contestants, their story would demonstrate a prime example of commercial hospitality projects done right.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal;"><font size="6">“What we’ve always tried to do is create experiences, not just hospitality”&nbsp;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">In 2023, Potentia Solutions Leisure hosts more than 15,000 customers a week, employing over 500 people.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">It all began only a very short time ago.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">“Most of the venues we’ve opened have been experiential” continues Christine.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">“For example, Lina is one of those beach clubs with an international DJ every weekend (think Dubai, Las Vegas, Mykonos) which doesn’t exist in Australia outside of resorts, a venue where you can swim in the pool, drink cocktails, enjoy live music”.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">“At (Peruvian-Japanese inspired) Soko we’ve got Peruvian Dancers, you can take photos, it’s a theatre show”&nbsp;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">“It’s not just a restaurant”.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">Lina Rooftop also features automatic doors, app-controlled lockers and a swimwear shop, taking great care to cater to the more luxurious desires of its customers, crafting an environment, an experience; one that rises well beyond the typical expectations of a hospitality venue.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">“What we’ve always tried to do is create experiences, not just hospitality” recounts Christine.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><font size="3">An experience to be shared indeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
